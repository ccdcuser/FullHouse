! Create a capture called 'MYCAP' and match anything using the source address 10.1.0.25 and destination port 80

capture MYCAP match tcp host 10.1.0.25 any eq 80


! Apply the MYCAP to an interface (vlan name)

capture MYCAP interface inside


! show all captures incase your are capturing more than one.

show capture


! show details specific to MYCAP

show capture MYCAP


! copy the capture as a *.pcap to a TFTP server.

copy /pcap capture:MYCAP tftp:













For Reference:

Use the "capture" command on the PIX, see here (http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/multisec/asa_sw/v_70/cref_txt/c.htm#wp1950270) for details. You cna capture traffic coming in one interface (pre-NAT) and capture it again as it goes out the egress interface (post-NAT), tne save it off the PIX in pcap format so you cna look at it with Ethereal.

As an example:

Problem:

User on the Inside with an IP of 192.168.1.8 is having a problem accessing Cisco.com (198.133.219.25). The user is getting NATed to 1.1.1.8

Step 1: Create ACL for both Inside and Outside Interface

access-list 100 permit tcp host 1.1.1.8 host 198.133.219.25 eq 80

access-list 100 permit tcp host 198.133.219.25 eq 80 host 1.1.1.8

access-list 101 permit tcp host 192.168.1.8 host 198.133.219.25 eq 80

access-list 101 permit tcp host 198.133.219.25 eq 80 host 192.168.1.8

Step 2: Create captures on both Inside and Outside Interface

capture out-web access-list 100 buffer 700000 interface outside packet-length 1518

capture in-web access-list 101 buffer 700000 interface inside packet-length 1518

Step 3: Have Inside user access www.cisco.com

Step 4: Copy the captures off to a TFTP server

copy capture:out-web tftp://10.1.1.10 pcap

copy capture:in-web tftp://10.1.1.10 pcap

OR copy using https:

http server enable

http 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 outside
